👉🏻 I create this project using Flexbox.
Learnings:-

    👉🏻. when I was applying media query box are overlapping on each other
       bacause I gave them ( height: 100%; ) property.
       
Solution:-  So after googling I find out problem
             and gave ( height: auto; ) to all div in media query only.
